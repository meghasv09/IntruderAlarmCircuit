# Intruder Alarm Circuit

## Overview
This circuit is designed to alert the user when an unauthorized person enters the home. It works by detecting changes in light intensity using a **photoresistor (LDR)**.

## How It Works
- The **LDR** is placed opposite to a **laser light source**.
- When the laser light is **uninterrupted**, the **buzzer and LED remain OFF**.
- If the laser light is **blocked or moved away**, the **buzzer and LED turn ON**, indicating an intrusion.

## Simulation Results
